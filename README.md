# KotlinChallenges
Repository contains Kotlin coding challenges.  

1. Write a function that checks whether a string contains unique characters or not. Return the string reversed only if 
the string characters are unique, otherwise return null.

2. Have the function String.ABCheck() receive String and return the string true if the characters a and b are
separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once
(i.e. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). 
Otherwise, return the string false.

3. Have the function Int.additivePersistence() receives an int which will always be a positive integer 
and returns its additive persistence which is the number of times you must add the digits in num until you
reach a single digit and the final stop value.
For example: if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 
and 1 + 8 = 9, and you stop at 9 and loop count is 2.
