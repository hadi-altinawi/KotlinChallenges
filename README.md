# KotlinChallenges
Repository contains Kotlin coding challenges.  

1. Write a function that checks whether a string contains unique characters or not. Return the string reversed only if 
the string characters are unique, otherwise return null.

2. Have the function String.ABCheck() receive String and return the string true if the characters a and b are
separated by exactly 3 places anywhere in the string at least once
(i.e. "lane borrowed" would result in true because there is exactly three characters between a and b). 
Otherwise, return the string false.
